# Extensions {#extensions}

The functionalities of GeoServer can be expanded using various extensions.
These extensions are divided to two categories: extensions, which are officially supported plug-ins, and community modules, which are more experimental in nature.

Many features that are available in a current base installation of GeoServer by default were once implemented as part of an extension and later integrated to the GS core.

The source code of available extensions can be viewed at the [official GeoServer GitHub repository](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/).
Both [extensions](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/tree/main/src/extension) and [community modules](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/tree/main/src/community) are located under the src directory.
